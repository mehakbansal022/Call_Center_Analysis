Project Objective

•	The project aims to utilize Power BI for comprehensive analysis of our call center operations. Key objectives include evaluating agent performance through metrics like speed of answer, average talk duration, and resolution rates to enhance operational efficiency and also gauge customer satisfaction using satisfaction ratings, identify trends in call topics and volume over time, and optimize resource allocation based on peak call times. 
•	Additionally, the analysis aims to pinpoint training needs, ensure quality assurance through resolved call assessments, and provide decision support for strategic improvements in overall service delivery.

Data Source

The dataset, sourced from the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program through Forage, comprises records from a customer service center. Each entry represents a call and includes details like Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, whether it was Answered (Yes/No), Resolved status, Speed of answer in seconds, and Average Talk Duration. The dataset offers insights into operational metrics and customer interactions within the call center environment, facilitating analysis and improvement of service delivery and efficiency.
